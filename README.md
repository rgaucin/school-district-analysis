# School District Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of the project was to reanalyze the academic performance of students at the schools of a particular school district after reports of academic dishonesty (specifically, within the ninth grade of Thomas High School). An initial analysis was run on data including student math and reading scores, school budget sizes, and school types (charter or district). After removing all potentially affected student scores, a second analysis aimed to compare the new findings with those of the initial analysis.

## Results

- District Summary
The district summary was largely unaffected, with each score metric of the new analysis being within 0.3 points of the original analysis.
